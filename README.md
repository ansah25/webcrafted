# 🌐 Webcrafted

**Webcrafted** is my first hands-on project to learn and apply **HTML** and **CSS** fundamentals. The goal of this project is to build a clean, responsive, and accessible website from scratch while reinforcing core front-end skills.

This project is part of my journey to become a **Full-Stack Developer** by Fall 2025.
